classical-graphs
================

This repository contains implementations of some classic graph algorithms. It was part of the material used for extension classes presented in 2012 at UFSCar Sorocaba. Algorithms were implemented in Python.

The following content was presented:
1. 2012-04-03: Data structures for graph representation: Adjacency Matrix; Dynamically and Statically allocated Adjacency List. For this class exceptionally, code was implemented in C.
2. 2012-04-10: Depth-first and Breadth-first search.
3. 2012-04-17: Minimum spanning tree - Prim's and Kruskal's algorithms.
4. 2012-05-15: Shortest path - Dijkstra's and A\* algorithms.
5. 2012-05-22: Strongly connected components - Tarjan's algorithm.
6. 2012-05-29: Maximum flow - Edmonds-Karp algorithm.
